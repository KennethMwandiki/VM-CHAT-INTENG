# Frontend â€” Live Streaming UI

About
-----

The frontend is a React-based UI that provides platform selection, stream setup, and monitoring for multi-platform live broadcasts. It consumes the backend REST API and ships styles and assets for branded deployments.

Quick start (local)
-------------------

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   yarn install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```sh
   yarn build
   ```

For containerized usage, see the root `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
# Frontend Service (React)
